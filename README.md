# CWF-Fall'20
**Project :** Joeyy - A Discord Bot written in Python. *(Will be deployed on Heroku)*<br>
Joeyy is a Discord bot which gives sarcastic replies to a user's messages in a server. It can also play music & do general stuff to manage a server.

### Project Analogy üìù 
**- Discord Bot :** The main folder which contains all the code which was used to build & run the bot.<br>
*inside Discord Bot folder :-*<br>
- Bot.py - The prime python script which acts a hub of all other command cogs.<br>
- Cogs - Contains the code for all the different stuff which the bot can do.<br>
- Others - Files which are used for deployment on Heroku.<br>

**- Tester:** contains trash prototype code for testing purposes.<br>
**- Lavalink, venv etc:** These are all the subsidary stuff of the project.

### Bot Commands ü§ñ

### Under Development ‚å®Ô∏è 
*Work in progress !* <br>
**Music bot** : Lavalink (Wavelink) is used to provide music playing commands. The code is somewhat finished, the process of intigrating it with the server & the main bot.py file is pending. <br>
**Snack-time reminder** : A Timely reminder whivh remind the 'active' server members to drink water or eat something. A little bit of tweaking with it's code is still needed for the function to run seamlessly.
